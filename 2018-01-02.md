#### esch notes

- more chili powder
- more cumin
- maybe tom paste for mike tyson action????

#### after thoughts

- esch was right about no sugar needed and more beans
- cilantry/parsley gel were fine
- maybe make it wetter with sauce because it seemed more like a stew
- seriously more cumin/chili powder next time
- PREPARE EVERYTHING AHEAD OF TIME, NEXT TIME
